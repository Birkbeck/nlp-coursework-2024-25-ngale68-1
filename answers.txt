Question 1(d):
The Flesch-Kincaid (FK) score can be unreliable in two key scenarios:

1. Non-standard grammar or literary style:
FK assumes standard sentence structure and punctuation. Texts with irregular grammar, such as
stream-of-consciousness writing (e.g., James Joyce), or those with long, complex sentences 
broken by semicolons or em dashes, can confuse sentence tokenizers and distort average sentence 
length, leading to misleading scores.

2. Vocabulary and conceptual complexity:
FK is based only on surface-level metrics — word length (syllables) and sentence length — and 
does not account for semantic difficulty. A text can have short, simple words and sentences but 
convey complex, abstract, or domain-specific concepts (e.g., legal or philosophical texts), 
which are cognitively demanding despite scoring as “easy.”

Additionally, FK performs poorly on poetry, dialogue-heavy texts, or any content where 
readability depends more on cultural context or background knowledge than linguistic structure.
